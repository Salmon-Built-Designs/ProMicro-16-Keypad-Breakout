# Single vs Dual Encoder
I found using dual encoders to help with many of the projects I was working on. A single encoder is great for volume up and down.

## Some Ideas for a 2nd Encoder
- Microphone Volume up and down / Press to Mute. (Custom Mapping req'd.)
- Zoom In and Out / Press to Reset. (Ctrl+, Ctrl-, Ctrl 0)
- Scroll Up and Down / Press to Home or End. (Page Up, Page Down, Home/End)
- Scrub Left and Right / Press Enter. (Left arrow, Right arrow, Enter)
- Add/Subtract Values / Press to Enter. ((+1 Enter),(-1 Enter), Enter) <- Using 1 as an increment example.
- Fast Forward / Rewind / Play/Pause. (FF,Rewind,Play/Pause)
- Cycle thru Open Windows / Press to Open.
- Cycle thru Browser Tabs.
- Use the 2nd Encoder Press for Mode Switching allowing an addtional key (Key 13) for assignment.
